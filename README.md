Are you a Hat in Time fan? Do you wish you could have Hat Kid dance to any track you like?
Well, do I have a solution for you!

Smug dance as a Service (SaaS) is here to help. Simply provide it with your favorite track's BPM
and it'll generate a GIF of Hat Kid dancing to that BPM.

## Where can I get the animation frames to set up my own instance?

You can't. Not right now, at least.

As for the animation frames, Git doesn't like large files, and having to deal with LFS is a royal
pain in the butt. Also my Internet is slow. Maybe someday.

As for the .blend file, I don't want to distribute Gears for Breakfast's game data without their
consent. Even though I did a lot of the work of hooking the animation up into Blender
(including materials), it's still not my animation, nor is the Hat Kid model mine, nor do I own the
textures used to put all the materials together.
